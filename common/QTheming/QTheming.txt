Changelog:
==========

2004-02-07
  - fixed: ProgressBar does not work with large Max values

2004-01-26
  - requires unofficial VisualCLX patches version 3.1
  - Added (button) theming for MDI Child's caption buttons
  - Faster painting under Linux (especially controls that need a border)
  - ISSUE: RadioGroupBox does not work under Linux because it needs a clWhite 
           mask. Under Windows it wants a black mask. If QThemed paints a 
           white mask the TRadioButton meight not work.
           If you want to activate this feature (maybe it works) open
           QThemed.pas and remove the dot (".") from
           {.$DEFINE USE_WHITE_RADIOMASK}
